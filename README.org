* An android podcast application
still very much a work in progress
** DONE don't hardcode navigation strings
** DONE don't hardcode spacing
** DONE store podcasts in a database
** DONE don't hardcode icon type
** DONE don't hardcode alt text
** DONE don't hardcode padding/spacing
** TODO don't allow adding multiple of the same podcast
probably the key is to make podcasts unique in their url. i'm not sure if that means that the primary index of a podcast should be its url, though - that seems a little suspect.
** DONE allow deletion of podcasts
** DONE add button to insert link from clipboard

** TODO periodically check podcasts for updates
** DONE don't use =State= in =ViewModel=​s
not really sure about this one, frankly - =StateFlow=​s seem to behave better with flows like from a database, but =State= is simpler in other cases
** TODO add tests [0/2]
*** TODO unit tests
*** TODO android/integration tests
** TODO try shared element transition
I'm imagining making the thumbnail animate from the view podcasts screen to the podcast details screen
