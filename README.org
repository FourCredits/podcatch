* An android podcast application
still very much a work in progress
** DONE don't hardcode navigation strings
** DONE don't hardcode spacing
** DONE store podcasts in a database
** DONE don't hardcode icon type
** DONE don't hardcode alt text
** DONE don't hardcode padding/spacing
** TODO don't allow adding multiple of the same podcast
probably the key is to make podcasts unique in their url. i'm not sure if that means that the primary index of a podcast should be its url, though - that seems a little suspect.
** DONE allow deletion of podcasts
** DONE add button to insert link from clipboard

** TODO improve xml parsing code
*** TODO make it slightly more declarative, build up a mini-dsl
*** TODO make it more fault tolerant
don't throw, at least
**** TODO handle faults at higher levels too
** DONE parse xml to list episodes
** TODO display images for podcasts
*** TODO parse from xml
*** TODO download
probably involves using coil?
** DONE download the episodes themselves
   CLOSED: [2024-05-12 Sun 17:56]
** DONE enable playing podcasts
   CLOSED: [2024-05-15 Wed 21:14]
** TODO periodically check podcasts for updates
** DONE don't use =State= in =ViewModel=​s
not really sure about this one, frankly - =StateFlow=​s seem to behave better with flows like from a database, but =State= is simpler in other cases
** TODO add tests [0/2]
*** TODO unit tests
*** TODO android/integration tests
** TODO try shared element transition
I'm imagining making the thumbnail animate from the view podcasts screen to the podcast details screen
** DONE Make screens a little better encapsulated and type-safe

*** DONE Move =compose= calls to their respective blocks
    CLOSED: [2024-05-11 Sat 19:10]

*** only for when i'm happy with mine, or really stuck
** TODO try using dash
** TODO extract podcast playing code into a separate part to allow for various things
*** TODO user should be able to navigate away from the episode details screen and come back, and have it still playing
