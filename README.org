* An android podcast application
still very much a work in progress
** DONE don't hardcode navigation strings
** DONE don't hardcode spacing
** DONE store podcasts in a database
** DONE don't hardcode icon type
** DONE don't hardcode alt text
** DONE don't hardcode padding/spacing
** TODO don't allow adding multiple of the same podcast
** DONE allow deletion of podcasts
** TODO add button to insert link from clipboard
** TODO improve xml parsing code
*** TODO make it slightly more declarative, build up a mini-dsl
*** TODO make it more fault tolerant
** TODO parse xml to list episodes
** TODO display images for podcasts
*** TODO parse from xml
*** TODO download
probably involves using coil?
** TODO download the episodes themselves
** TODO enable playing podcasts
** TODO periodically check podcasts for updates
** DONE don't use =State= in =ViewModel=​s
not really sure about this one, frankly - =StateFlow=​s seem to behave better with flows like from a database, but =State= is simpler in other cases
** TODO add tests [0/2]
*** TODO unit tests
*** TODO android/integration tests
** TODO try shared element transition
I'm imagining making the thumbnail animate from the view podcasts screen to the podcast details screen
** TODO read up on some things [0/2]
*** TODO Room basics
[[https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room]]
*** TODO Migrating Room databases
[[https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/migrating-db-versions]]
** TODO check out the example podcast app
*** link
[[https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/Jetcaster][compose-samples/Jetcaster]]
*** only for when i'm happy with mine, or really stuck
