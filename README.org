** TODO enable playing podcasts
** TODO periodically check podcasts for updates
** DONE don't use =State= in =ViewModel=​s
not really sure about this one, frankly - =StateFlow=​s seem to behave better with flows like from a database, but =State= is simpler in other cases
** TODO add tests [0/2]
*** TODO unit tests
*** TODO android/integration tests
** TODO try shared element transition
I'm imagining making the thumbnail animate from the view podcasts screen to the podcast details screen
** DONE Make screens a little better encapsulated and type-safe
